# What Is Ethical Agile?

Love it or hate it, Waterfall gave us plenty of time to contemplate. Way too much! One of our goals using more modern approaches 
like Agile, CI/CD or even GitOps is to move much faster and try stuff for real rather than just attempt to 
think everything through in advance. The benefits of that are obvious, we move much, much faster. We can get ideas into the field 
1000x quicker than we did even 5 years ago. The risks are less obvious; when we move fast we break things. Some of those things we 
want to break and some we don't.

The Ethical Agile project is designed to work out processes and checklists that will help guide developers in adding points of 
ethical reflection to our processes - we'll probably start with SCRUM. There are several groups working on this & we'll start 
publishing stuff here as soon as we have it.
