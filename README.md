This repo serves 2 purposes:
- to be a list of resources to read about the current thinking on ethics related to technology
- to track our progress coming up with Ethical Agile processes. Checklists and approaches for adding ethical consideration into our development lifecycle.

We've already started building the links and welcome suggestions and contributions, just raise a PR. The work on processes is coming soon!
