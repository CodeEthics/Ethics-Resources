New Economy Risk Model
The new economy risk model enables development teams to navigate the thin-line between tech disruption and displacement. Balancing human rights and universal needs with capital gain, we create a win-win for society and the economy through more valuable, sustainable and innovative tech.

Stage 1: Understanding the Reason
When briefing, desgning or developing tech:
Consider the Challenges
What’s the purpose?
What’s the value?
Why is it needed?
Where’s the power?

Consider the Opportunities How might you increase process transparency. How might you enable broader social value?
Context A: Considering Human Rights
Tech products and services have demonstrable positive and negative impact on people's access to income & housing, opportunities in healthcare & education and reliable information & communication. Therefore, considering our impact on people and creating tech that is valuable to people is essential.

Stage 2: Understanding the User
When briefing, desgning or developing tech:
Consider the challenges
Who is it benefiting?
Who is it impacting?
Who is it harming?
What are the consequences?

Consider the Opportunities
How might you include diverse perspectives?

Context B: Considering Capital Gain
Tech products and services more often than not utilise product and services design to generate turnover and deliver a financial return, with market competition a major driving factor in tech development. Therefore, delivering profit in a responsible way for our organisations and in a sustainble way for society is essential.

Stage 3: Understanding the Goal

When briefing, desgning or developing tech:
Consider the challenges
What are the outcomes?
Who’s responsible ?
What are the opportunities?

Consider the Opportunities How might you share your organisation's learnings? How might you offset you societal impact?

Context C: Considering Universal Need
Tech products and services have the potential to impact people being able to realise universal human need, including having safety and security, finding conection and belonging and achieving fulfillment and a sense of meaning in their lives in a major way. Considering tech's bigger picture purpose and enhancing our innovative efforts is therefore essential.
