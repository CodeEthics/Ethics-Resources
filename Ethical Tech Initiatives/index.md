# Resources on Existing Ethics Initiatives in Tech
Tech think tank [Doteveryone](https://doteveryone.org.uk/) have put together a very [comprehensive list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SN6hYeKe3eRK6x9D0Sr7GpCA4nirpyo3u68xG1A6NDs/edit) of all the initiatives they know of. There are lots!
We are encouraged to update it. They are also kicking off their own movement, which I've included an introduction to below.

# Doteveryone's View On What Responsible Technology Means
(Ed. Note - this is UK tech think tank [Doteveryone](https://doteveryone.org.uk/)'s suggestion. Like everything here, it's a part of the debate not the end of it!

## Introduction
Responsible Technology considers the social impact it creates and the unintended consequences it might have

We need a movement towards a responsible technology mindset where those who create and own technology look not only at individual people in one aspect of their lives, but recognise that both their users and technology don’t exist in isolation.  This isn’t about tech for good or ethics, this is about a basic responsibility and expectation that technologies do not create or deepen existing inequalities, recognise and respect everyone’s rights and dignity, and give people trust and confidence in their use.

## The 3 Cs of Responsible Technology

Teams that create responsible technology products will strive to consider these core concepts: 
- Context: looking beyond the individual user and taking into account technology’s potential impact and  consequences on society 
- Contribution: sharing how value is created in a transparent and understandable way
- Continuity: ensuring best practice in technology that accounts for real, messy humans 

This is a resource guide to accompany a greater system currently being developed by Doteveryone to motivate and support businesses to develop responsible technology.  

## Responsible Business 
(Ed. This i snot really for techies, unless you are building a startup, which you might be)

While our responsible technology system focuses on specific technology products or services, the business model and the ownership and control of the organisation are equally important parts of ensuring technology is created responsibly. 

The business model and organisational structure should be appropriate for the product or services being offered. That might mean an organisation being a social enterprise, worker owned co-operative, or a B corp, or it might be a conventional for-profit company or corporate, or an appropriate public body. 

It will be clear that the value given and received by different stakeholders is reasonable for the type of product or service. Stakeholders include those who control or own or benefit from the organisation, as well as workers, users, partners, etc, and these should be considered in light of the business model, meaning who pays for what and related choices around customers, suppliers, intellectual property and other assets, and investors.

It’s particularly important that the business model is clear if it is based around hard to perceive things, such as repackaging, licensing or selling data or insights from it. 

The organisation creating the product or service will be established in an appropriate location or locations, and will of course follow local and international laws, pay required taxes, and should also consider international business conventions and guides to proper conduct as defined by the United Nations.  

There needs to be some sort of structure which can be responsible for the product or service and can be held liable if there are problems (this might be harder for a purely free open source collaboration without structure).

## Inclusive Employment, Fair Pay and Conditions
All the workers involved in creating the product, service or system should have fair pay, including paying any local minimum or living wages, and fair conditions without exploitation. Local taxes, healthcare, social security and similar should be provided. 

Workplaces should be inclusive, welcoming different gender, age, ethnicity, etc. 

Executive remuneration should not be unreasonable compared to the lowest compensated team members.  

These conditions should apply not just to those directly creating or operating a digital service, but also any people whom work is outsourced to, and as far as possible also other subcontractors, hosting providers and so on.

Considerations might include how shifts are organised; how promotions and bonuses are awarded and transparency around this. 

Democratic engagement of workers with organisational processes might be a plus if they are interested in that structure; but we perhaps shouldn’t assume this is always desirable.

The balance between shared reward and shared risk should be considered - increased rights might come with increased responsibilities. 

Fairness and decent treatment is important here; the Zappos example of low CEO salary is cute, but a low CEO salary isn’t necessarily something to aspire to; this doesn’t mean everyone has to be an employee on payroll.
