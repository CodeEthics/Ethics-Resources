# How To Think About Ethics
A list of resources on thinking techniques particularly for abstract reasoning and reasoning at scale, which is vital to developers but very difficult 
for humans to do.

“One way to improve a person’s capacity to do good is to increase the accuracy of their beliefs. 
Since people’s actions are determined by their desires and their beliefs, a person aiming to do good 
will generally do more good the more accurate their beliefs are.” - [Effective Altruism Concept Map](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/improving-the-accuracy-of-beliefs/)

## Specific Biases Worth Knowing

### [Scope Insensitivity](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/waF2Pomid7YHjfEDt/p/2ftJ38y9SRBCBsCzy)
“Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88”

Humans are very bad at gut reasoning about large numbers (big==big). 

### [Status Quo Bias](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/after-service/201609/how-powerful-is-status-quo-bias)
“The status quo effect is pervasive in both inconsequential and major decisions. Oftentimes we are held back by what we believe to be the safe option, simply because it is the default.”

Humans tend to fear failures of commission more than omission.

## Debiasing - In General
There's a problem. Trying to avoid bias might actually make you worse.

“￼Studying biases can in fact make you more vulnerable to overconfidence and confirmation bias, as you come to see the influence of cognitive biases all around you—in everyone but yourself. And the bias blind spot, unlike many biases, is especially severe among people who are especially intelligent, thoughtful, and open-minded. ” - [Biases, an introduction](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ptxnyfLWqRZ98wnYi/biases-an-introduction), from Rationality A-Z
