# CoedEthics

13th July 2018, The Reactor, Shoreditch

A conference about tech ethics from a developer's perspective.

 - What should we be thinking about when we design, write, test or observe our code and products? 
 - Should we define an ethical code for software developers?
 - How do ethics work at web scale?
 - Wanting to be ethical is one thing, what processes or tools can we use to make ethics actually happen?

We'll ask a lot of questions. Hopefully, we'll generate some thoughts, ideas, and community.  

CoedEthics will be a one day conference with a vigorous hallway track! We will be encouraging new speakers and new debates. We'll have talks, panels & an open mic.

We only have limited capacity, we'll open up ticket sales soon.

## Who Are We?
CoedEthics is a conference from the people behind CoedCode, the tech meetup for all ages, genders, races, levels of experience and (dis)abilities. Ethics in tech is a debate for everyone.

## What Are We Going to Do on GitHub?
Watch this space. We'll be using GitHub to start building, soliciting and listing resources for developers who want to know more about ethics in tech.
